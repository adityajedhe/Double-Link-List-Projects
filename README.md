# Double Link List Projects

## Projects

### 1. Binary Tree Operations Using Double Link List

In this project, I have implemented various binary tree operations using a double link list. The operations include insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching within a binary tree structure.

#### List of Operations:
01. Create a binary tree
02. Insert a node in the binary tree
03. Delete a node from the binary tree
04. Search for a node in the binary tree
05. Traverse the binary tree
    > Pre-order
    > In-order
    > Post-order
    > Level-order
06. Find the height of the binary tree
07. Find the number of nodes in the binary tree
08. Find the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree
09. Find the number of non-leaf nodes in the binary tree
10. Find the number of full nodes in the binary tree
11. Find the number of half nodes in the binary tree
12. Find the number of sibling of a node in the binary tree
13. Find the number of cousins of a node in the binary tree
14. Find the number of descendants of a node in the binary tree
15. Find the number of ancestors of a node in the binary tree
16. Find the ancestor of a node in the binary tree
17. Find the level of a node in the binary tree
18. Find all the nodes at the border of the binary tree

#### Implementation Details:
- **Language Used:** C++
- **Data Structure:** Double Link List
- **Complexity:** The time and space complexity for each operation is analyzed and optimized for efficient performance.

### 2. Tower of Hanoi

This project involves solving the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using a double link list. The solution demonstrates the use of double link lists to manage the movement of disks between the towers efficiently.

#### Implementation Details:
- **Language Used:** C++
- **Data Structure:** Double Link List
- **Complexity:** The solution is designed to minimize the number of moves and optimize the performance.
