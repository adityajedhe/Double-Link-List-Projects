# Double Link List Projects

## Projects

### 1. Binary Tree Operations Using Double Link List
In this project, I have implemented various binary tree operations using a double link list. The operations include insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching within a binary tree structure.

### 2. Tower of Hanoi
This project involves solving the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using a double link list. The solution demonstrates the use of double link lists to manage the movement of disks between the towers efficiently.
